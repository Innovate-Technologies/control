# Control

A modern control panel for services provided by SHOUTca.st.

Control is designed for modern browsers, and as such, it will not support legacy browsers.

# Style guide

Instead of following a formal style guide, just make sure that any new
code passes ESLint (a git hook is provided to run ESLint automatically)
and follows the existing code style.

It will also be dual licensed to allow us to continue offering our own version

without the need to make these changes publicly available.
