# Control

A modern control panel for services provided by SHOUTca.st.

Currently, it only handles the extra services, but that'll change when
Cast v1.0, our own streaming server, is available.

# Versioning

Control is still under heavy development, so things may still be
unstable and releases can be broken.

As of July 2015, this is why Control's major version is still 0.

Control is expected to reach 1.0 when it has support for Cast and has
all major issues fixed.

# Style guide

Instead of following a formal style guide, just make sure that any new
code passes JSHint (a git hook is provided to run JSHint automatically)
and follows the existing code style.

# License

Control is released under a private license for the moment, but this is
expected to change when Control switches to a modular architecture. As
that is a major change and will basically require the whole application
to be rebuilt, it will probably take a while before Control has a
stripped Community Edition (CE) that can be properly released under an
open-source edition (potentially AGPL). The current version would then
be a derivative work of the CE which would thus need to be dual licensed.

TL;DR: Legal stuff is complicated. The current license is:
