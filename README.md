# Control

A modern control panel for services provided by SHOUTca.st.

Control is designed for modern browsers, and as such, it will not support legacy browsers.

# Style guide

Instead of following a formal style guide, just make sure that any new
code passes ESLint (`npm run lint` can be used for this)
and follows the existing code style.

# License

Control is released under a private license for the moment,
but a stripped Community Edition (CE) that is only for controlling Cast
will be released under AGPLv3 in the near future.

It will also be dual licensed to allow us to continue offering our own version
with extra additions (such as extra services),
without the need to make these changes publicly available.

The current license is:
